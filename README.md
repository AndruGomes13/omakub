# Omakub

## CLI-only Shell Install

Want just the terminal experience without the full Ubuntu desktop setup? Install the zsh configuration with modern CLI tools (eza, bat, fzf, zoxide, starship) on Linux or macOS:

```bash
# Linux
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndruGomes13/omakub/master/boot-linux-zsh.sh)

# macOS
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndruGomes13/omakub/master/boot-mac-zsh.sh)
```

This installs zsh with autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, the starship prompt, and useful aliases.

## Intro

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
